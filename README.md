# CS50 - Final Project: "cOFFline"

## Foreword:

This project was developed within the CS50 course and would not be possible without the great Prof. David Malan. 

Prof. Malan and his teaching fellows kept me motivated throughout the year and helped me reach my goal of creating an app from scratch and without prior programming knowledge in this field.

## Intro:
Caffeine is a stimulant found in several beverages, food, and medicine. Healthy doses can make you more alert but too much caffeine can make you feel jittery, cause headaches, and hinder your sleep.

## The App:
cOFFline is an iOS app that lets you track and monitor your caffeine intake. It helps you reach your caffeine goal in milligrams before going to bed in order to have a restful sleep. This app will support you in having and healthy relationship with caffeine. You will be surprised how changing small habits can make a big impact through awareness.

In version 1.0 you can add different coffee types for your intake and the app will track your caffeine intake over the day and show your optimal sleep time.

## Customizing: 
You can customize the app by choosing your sensitivity and your milligram goal of caffeine you want to have before going to sleep.

The sensitivity level you can choose from are the following:

- Low: Caffeine Half-Life of 4 hours
- Medium: Caffeine Half-Life of 6 hours
- Strong: Caffeine Half-Life of 8 hours 

Example: By choosing the medium (half-life of 6 hours) sensitivity and having 200mg caffeine at 1 pm, you would still have 100 mg caffeine at 7 pm.


## Features:
- Light and Dark Theme
- Three languages (English, German, Polish)
- Notification after reaching your caffeine goal
- Alert after having over 400mg of caffeine

## Future / Planned features:
- Statistics Overview
- Logging and letting the user delete individual drinks
- Adding different beverages like Cola, Tea, caffeine tablets and Energy Drinks
- Letting the user customize every beverage and its caffeine contents
